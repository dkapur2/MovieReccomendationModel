# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Model

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using machine learning techniques. The model is built to recommend movies based on user preferences, using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods. This project showcases  skills in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **Python programming**.

## 📄 Overview

The movie recommendation model helps users find movies that match their tastes based on previous ratings and preferences. It leverages a dataset containing user ratings and applies machine learning algorithms to suggest movies.

## ✨ Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Makes recommendations based on similar users' preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to those a user has enjoyed.
- **User Rating Predictions:** Predicts ratings for movies a user has not yet rated.
- **Python-Based Implementation:** Developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration.
  
## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for the implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for model development.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Array operations and mathematical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms for recommendation systems.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization to better understand patterns.
- **Surprise**: Python library for building and evaluating recommendation algorithms.
  
## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of movie ratings from users, including:

- **User IDs** 
- **Movie IDs**
- **Ratings**
- **Timestamps**

You can download a similar dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), a widely used dataset for recommendation system research.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-model.git
   cd movie-recommendation-model

2. **Intall the dependencies**:
   Ensure you have pip installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   You can launch the project by running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MovieRec.ipynb

## 🛠 How it Works

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared by handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

2. Model Training: Various recommendation algorithms, including collaborative and content-based filtering, are trained on the data.

3. Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to measure the accuracy of recommendations.

## 🔍 Future Enhancements

- Incorporating deep learning models for more accurate recommendations.
- Adding to personal portfolio website for professional profile
